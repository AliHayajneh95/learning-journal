I learn how to do these things by doing this reading

- [x] A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- [x] Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
- [x] programming a computer has to be step by step, computers don't work like humans.
- [x] to approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task.
- [x] i learnt that there are 2 types of expressions some are complix like x = 3*4 and some a straight forword like x = 3
- [x] also i learnt about operators both logical and arithmatic
- [x] even string operations
- [x] functions are great, they let you make bunch of statements and execute them where ever you want and even let you reuse them as you like which works great for a task that you want your code to repeat.
- [x] functions can be provided with data through the paranthesis when called or even return data if execution is done.
