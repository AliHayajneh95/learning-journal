## Mastering Markdown

I think i just mastered markdown by learning several things like:

-Task Lists
-Tables
-SHA references
-Automatic linking for URLs
-Emoji
 and much more
 
 ## Github Pages
 
 I learned that github can help me build things that can help people, and get a job and even change the world!,
 since today we can inform the world and society about us by websites, and github helps you to create a website
 without all the mess that you will have to go through,with git hub i dont have to set up servers, no databases
 and not even learn html, everything just works!(looks like the world WILL be saved baby), there is even
 prebuilt themes, and you can export your pages and work on them any where, which after all helps you to focus
 on the content of your page rather than wasting so much effort into making sure that everyone has the right version
 of the page.
 
 also i learned how to
 -Clone the repository
 -use different git clients
 - and even did my hello world first app (told you the world is going to be saved, look above if you didn't)
 
  ## Basic writing and formatting in markdown
  - Heading, Styling texts(**Bold**, * *italic * *, ~~strike~~, etc), lists, nested lists, taks lists(aka checkboxes)
  and even some more features on github like how teams communicate, pull requests, etc.
