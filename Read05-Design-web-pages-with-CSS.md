I learn how to do these things by doing this reading

- [x] CSS treats each html element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate
how that element should look.
- [x] rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like)
- [x] different types of selectors allwo you to target your rules at different elements
- [x] css rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an html page.
- [x] color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood.
- [x] there are three ways t ospecify colors in CSS(rgb values, hex codes, and color names)
- [x] color pickers can help you find the color you want
- [x] it is important to ensure that there is enought contrast betweeen any text and the background
color
- [x] CSS3 has introduced and extra value for rgb colors to indicate opacity (RGBA)
- [x] CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value.HSLA
