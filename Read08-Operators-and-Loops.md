I learn how to do these things by doing this reading

- [x] the strict equal checker === checks if the 2 values are of same type and value
- [x] the normal equal checker == checks if the 2 values are the same
- [x] also you can make not equal to != and strict not equal to !==
- [x] also you can make multiple comparisons like >= and <=
- [x] the for loop statement consists of 3 parts, and here is an example to explain them
        for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {

        }
- [x] first part is (var i = 0;) which is called initialization statement
- [x] second part is (i < 0;) which is the condition statement
- [x] third part is (i++) which is the update statement
- [x] we can say the body is the fourth part which will contain the statements to be executed
- [x] and there is another loop statement called the while loop which doesnt consist of initialization and no update her eis an expample
        while(i < 10)
        {
            //code to be executed
        }
        so obviously i has to be declared before the while or somewhere before this point
        and the update will occure in the body of the loop
