## Choosing an editor

One should be picky and choosy when it comes to text editor, well tailored text editor can make writing code
flow more easily, and here is a list of options i had to choose from

1. NotePad++(for windows users only, also my favorite)
2. TextWrangler(for mac users only), also you can get BB which is said to be a more mature version
3. Visual Studio Code (this is the one i had to go with because its a requirement in our course,
another step for microsoft to conquer the world)
4. Atom (by the folks at github)
5. Brackets
6. Sublime Text

keep in mind a text editor is not an IDE, you have to download the rest parts of your programming language to be able to programm
with it, also its very limited to being a text editor, no drag drop features etc.
