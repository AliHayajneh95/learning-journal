## My first github push/pull

here is a list of things i learnt in this lab

[x] Downloading my repository into my pc through ubuntu
[x] Opening VS code and making changes to web pages
[x] Updating my local project to the copy on github

i also added a table with all web pages on my learning journal


and here are 3 things to remember to stay in the growthmindset"

- give your self a releif knowing you can always do better and the bad things that happenned are there to learn
- don't be negative
- don't base you happieness on others opinions and experiences that can either go bad or good
